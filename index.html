        <span>By whom the worlds were made,</span><br>
        (O happy morn! illustrious hour!)<br>
        <span>Was once in flesh arrayed.</span><br>

        Then shone almighty power and love,<br>

        When Jesus left His throne above,<br>
        <span>To dwell with sinful worms.</span><br>
        <br>
        To dwell with misery below,<br>
        <span>The Saviour left the skies,</span><br>

        <span>That worthless man might rise.</span><br>
        <br>

        <br>
        Those watchful eyes that never sleep,<br>

        <br>
        Bought with the blood which freely flow'd<br>

        Now may that love, Immortal King,<br>
        <span>Speak some forgiving word,</span><br>

        A host that near His presance stands,<br>
        <span>And palms of vict'ry grace their hands.</span><br>

        Say, who are these I now behold,<br>

        <span>To Him who sits upon the throne.</span><br>
        <br>
        These are the foll'wers of the Lamb;<br>
        <span>From tribulation great they came;</span><br>
        And on the hill of sweet repose,<br>
        <span>They bid adieu to all their woes.</span><br>
        <br>
        Soon on the wings of love you'll fly<br>

        Mercy, grown weary, shall in righteous judgment<br>
        <span><span>Quit you forever.</span</span><br>
        <br>
        Where the worm dies not, and the fire eternal<br>
        <span>Fills the lost soul with anguish and with terror,</span><br>
        There shall the sinner spend a long forever,<br>
        <span><span>Dying unpardoned.</span</span><br>
        <br>
        O guilty sinner, hear the voice of warning!<br>
        <span>Fly to the Saviour, and embrace His pardon;</span><br>
        So shall your spirit meet, with joy triumphant,<br>
