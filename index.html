        Thy wrath awakes our humble dread!<br>
        <span>We fear the Pow'r that strikes us dead.</span><br>

        <span>Fits us to die and dwell with Thee.</span><br>

        <span>Let this animate you to march on your way.</span><br>

        He's full of compassion, and mighty to save,<br>
        <span>His arms are extended your soul to receive.</span><br>
        <br>
        Farewell, careless sinners! For you I must grieve<br>

        The judgment approaches—O think of your doom,<br>
