        A thousand ages in Thy sight<br>

        Short as the watch that ends the night<br>
        <span>Before the rising dawn.</span><br>
        <br>
        The busy tribes of flesh and blood,<br>
        <span>With all their lives and cares,</span><br>
        Are carried downwards by the flood,<br>
        <span>And lost in following years.</span><br>
        <br>
        Time, like an ever-rolling stream,<br>
        <span>Bears all its sons away;</span><br>
        They fly, forgotten as a dream<br>
        <span>Dies at the opening day.</span><br>
        <br>
        Like flow'ry fields the nations stand,<br>
        <span>Pleased with the morning light;</span><br>
        Tho flow'rs beneath the mower's hand<br>
        <span>Lie withered ere 'tis night.</span><br>
        <br>
        O God, our help in ages past,<br>
        <span>Our hope for years to come,</span><br>
        Be Thou our guard while troubles last,<br>
        <span>And our eternal home.</span><br>

        They rage and strive, desire and love,<br>
        <span>But all their noise is vain.</span><br>

        I give my mortal interest up,<br>

        <b>T</b>here is a fountain filled with blood,<br>
        <span>Drawn from Immanuel's veins;</span><br>
        And sinners plunged beneath that flood,<br>
        <span>Lose all their guilty stains.</span><br>
        <br>
        The dying thief rejoiced to see<br>
        <span>That fountain in his day:</span><br>
        And there may I, though vile as he,<br>
        <span>Wash all my sins away.</span><br>
        <br>
        Thou dying Lamb! Thy precious blood<br>
        <span>Shall never lose its power,</span><br>
        Till all the ransomed Church of God<br>
        <span>Are saved to sin no more.</span><br>
        <br>
        E'er since, by faith, I saw the stream<br>
        <span>Thy flowing wounds supply,</span><br>
        Redeeming love has been my theme<br>
        <span>And shall be till I die</span><br>
        <br>
        Then in a nobler, sweeter song,<br>
        <span>I'll sing thy power to save,</span><br>
        When this poor, lisping, stamm'ring tongue<br>
        <span>Lies silent in the grave.</span><br><br>

        <span>From Thy wounded side that flowed,</span><br>
        Be of sin the perfect cure;<br>
        <span>Save me, Lord, and make me pure.</span><br>
        <br>
        Should my tears forever flow,<br>
        <span>Should my zeal no languor know,</span><br>
        These for sin could ne'er atone;<br>
        <span>Thou must save, and Thou alone.</span><br>
        In my hand no price I bring<br>
        <span>Simply to Thy cross I cling.</span><br>

        <span>When my eyes shall close in death,</span><br>
        When I rise to worlds unknown,<br>
        <span>And behold Thee on Thy throne,</span><br>
